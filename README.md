# Elm Algorithms [![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/check-it-out.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)
This repository is just to store some algorithms that I am developing to train the Elm language. Current it have:

- Merge Sort
- Kth Lowest Element
- Selection Sort

You can check a live demo [here](https://allannozomu.github.io/Elm-Algorithms/). It has some visualization of the algorithms that I am running.
To get the steps of the sort algorithms, some bad implementation was done, because I have to get all the states in each recursive call =|

I have updated it to work with Elm 0.19
